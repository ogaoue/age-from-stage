This script accompanied Gaoue et al (2013) Journal of Ecology and use age-from-stage models to estimate life history parameters in a constant environment. It created a big function that takes as argument your T matrix (as in A=T + F decomposition) and generate the following output: 

Life expectancy (stage-specific): mean, variance, sd and cv
Age specific survivorship curves
Age specific mortality trajectory
Mean age at maturity and stage specific reproductve ages
Sensitivity and Elasticity of life expectancy
