# age-from-stage
## This script accompanied Gaoue et al (2013) Journal of Ecology and use age-from-stage models to estimate life history parameters in a constant environment. It created a big function that takes as argument your T matrix (as in A=T + F decomposition) and generate the following output.

## Outputs: #####################################################
## Life expectancy (stage-specific): mean, variance, sd and cv
## Age specific survivorship curves
## Age specific mortality trajectory
## Mean age at maturity and stage specific reproductve ages
## Sensitivity and Elasticity of life expectancy
